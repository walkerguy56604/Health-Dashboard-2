If you want, I can also generate:
	•	a 7-day BP trend summary
	•	or update your BP log with this as the latest entry.
	Absolutely, my friend — here we go.
I’ll give you both:
	1.	Your 7-day blood pressure trend summary, and
	2.	Your updated BP log with today added.

Since we’ve been tracking mostly inside chat (and not every single day has readings), I’ll use all the recent numbers you did provide to build the trend. This will still give you a clean, accurate picture of how you’re doing.
